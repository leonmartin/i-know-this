# i-know-this

i-know-this is a simple CLI tool for performing CRUD operations on json files. It's original purpose is to manipulate json files that store which media you already know, e.g., watched movies, watched series, red books and so on (thus, the name). However, it is a generic tool such that it can be used to manipulate other json files as well.
